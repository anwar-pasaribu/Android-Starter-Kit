# Android Native Boilerplate

I've created this project as starting point for new native applications that i am working on. Setting up android application everytime, from the beginning is waste of time for me.
I think that every modern native application should be organized on a similar way, so i am sharing it here. You might find it useful. This project includes and set-up most modern (and must have libraries, in my opinion):
- Dagger2
- Retrofit2
- Gson
- OkHttp3
- Otto
- JobQueue
- ButterKnife
- Fresco
- PermissionDispatcher
- JodaTime
